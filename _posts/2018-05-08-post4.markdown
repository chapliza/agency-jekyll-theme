description: There are approximately 2,000 characters in A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin. The task is to predict which characters in the series will live or die (based on the data from the first 5 books), and give data-driven recommendations on how to survive in Game of Thrones. A great way to practice some feature engineering, variable selection, and model development. No spoilers, just Data Science. *wink wink*Â
